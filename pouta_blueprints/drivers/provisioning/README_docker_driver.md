# DockerDriver

## Getting started

After following the standard install instructions the following additional steps
are required to activate docker driver:

### Pull the docker images

At the time of writing, docker driver will try to upload two images to new notebook hosts. The images
will need to be downloaded from dockerhub and placed in worker's /images -directory:

As cloud-user on the server, pull the images
    
    docker pull rocker/rstudio
    docker pull rocker/ropensci

Then stream the images to worker:/images/ over ssh

    docker save rocker/rstudio | ssh worker sudo dd of=/images/rocker.rstudio.img
    docker save rocker/ropensci | ssh worker sudo dd of=/images/rocker.ropensci.img

### Configure the driver

Change the following configuration variables in the web configuration page visible for admins.

    PLUGIN_WHITELIST DockerDriver
    DD_SHUTDOWN_MODE False

### Open port 8000 in your security group

The notebook connections from clients to the backing docker containers are proxied
through port 8000 on the server. Make sure that is open to the networks you want to
expose the system to.
