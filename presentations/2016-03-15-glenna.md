# Overview

## Product 

- web interface to resources provisioned in the cloud
- open source project hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/CSC-IT-Center-for-Science/pouta-blueprints)
- developed by CSC - IT Center for Science 
- buzzwords: Docker, Angular, RESTful, Ansible, self service, SAML2, notebook
- currently the resources can be VMs or containers

## Concepts

- system admins make _blueprints_, e.g. configurations
- users launch _instances_ of blueprints
- instances are time limited, quota limited, disposable
- users are authenticated (unlike http://tmpnb.org)
- user accounts are either
    - locally added by admin (via activation email)
    - based on SAML2 identity

## Service

- CSC runs a Pouta Blueprints server
- open to anyone with HAKA credentials
- currently in public beta
- blueprints for RStudio and IPython/Jupyter notebooks
- available at https://pb.csc.fi
- deployed in cPouta

# Demo at [https://pb.csc.fi](https://pb.csc.fi)

# Use case: Notebooks for a course on pb.csc.fi

## The Professor 

"I would like to have an RStudio environment where I can just point my
students to by sharing a link. The environment should contain the latest
version of the exercises I made."
 
## The Professor 

- prepares a notebook for a lecture
- uploads it somewhere in the web
- points the students to https://pb.csc.fi

## The Students

- log in with HAKA
- launch an instance of the course blueprint
- learn something
- submit results 

## The System

- launches a new container per student
- downloads the newest version of the lecture notebook
- manages a pool of VMs running these containers
- removes VMs when they expire

# Missing bits

## Permanent storage

- currently all instance data is deleted when the instance lifetime ends
- a permanent session concept would make the service useful for serious work
- many open questions from technical to policy level
- IMHO: if there is storage, it needs to be reliable from the start
- External storage? OwnCloud for the rescue?

## User grouping

- currently no grouping of users, just a flat list with admin flag on or off
- groups would be useful for 
    - limiting access and visibility to blueprints
    - creating global blacklists, whitelists

## Customer power users

- only admins can manage blueprints
- currently users that have admin rights are full admins
- in pb.csc.fi CSC admins will have to make all modifications to blueprints -> does not scale
- enter Customer power users
    - can create a user group
    - can assign selected properties of blueprints (whitelist, bootstrap url, ...)

## Accounting

- before the usage of pb.csc.fi becomes substantial, we need to be able to track who
  is running and how much
- with the additional features above, a single service instance can be used to provide 
  custom, private content for a closed course etc.
- we need a link to resource allocation process

## Access to pb.csc.fi with Kalmar2

- I hope to get some ideas here today, talking with you!

## Kubernetes?

- provide a deployment method for running on OpenShift/Kubernetes
- provide a driver to provision instances on OpenShift/Kubernetes

# Over and out, thanks!
